IDEAS FOR SPEEDING UP THE SOLVING PROCESS:
    - use constant numbers and a switch jump table for executing all operations instead of strings and ifs.
    - implement proper partial rotations instead of forward-backward turning (in rotateRightUp() etc.)
    - don't execute opposite operations one after another
